## Overview

Welcome to Homebase! Your own place on the web to collaborate with your group on finding housing. Making apartment hunting (for a group) suck less.

### Team Name: Homebase
### Team Members:
* Ashwin Kumar
* Nina Hwang
* David Stavis
* Kelley Puckett


## MVP

* A user can create an account and login to Homebase
* A group can set their apartment preferences:
    - Price
    - Bedrooms
    - Bathrooms
    - Location (general location as a 'radio button' within SF)
* The group's page can only be viewed by members (it has to be private online you are logged in and have access to the group)
* A user can add other people to the group by inviting them (perhaps not MVP?)
* A user can pin a post (mark it as a favorite post) - (perhaps not MVP?)
